### Research Interests
My research focuses on IoT network applications with an emphasis on cybersecurity and decentralized architectures. My current projects include developing systems using fog and edge computing, deploying wearable devices, environmental sensors, and LLMs at the edge. I am also integrating blockchain technologies, federated learning, and end-to-end encryption into these implementations to enhance security and privacy. Recently, I've been exploring embedded systems and other AI models to achieve more intelligent and sustainable designs.

### Short Bio
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher and Sessional Lecturer at the University of Guelph. I graduated with my Ph.D. degree from the University of Guelph's College of Engineering in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, in 2023. There, I also obtained an M.A.Sc. in Engineering Systems and Computing in 2020 and a B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering in 2018.
