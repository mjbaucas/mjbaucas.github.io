### Research Interests
My research focuses on IoT network applications, with an emphasis on cybersecurity and decentralized network architectures. I implement IoT systems using fog and edge computing, and develop platforms for deploying wearable devices, environmental sensors, and large language models at the edge. My work integrates blockchain, federated learning, and different end-to-end encryption techiques to enhance data security and privacy. Recently, I have been exploring the integration of AI models and embedded systems to enable more intelligent and sustainable IoT applications.
